This is not another git vs hg article. Others have written those articles and it doesn't matter anyway; git has already won the war.

Instead, I want to persuade you that you should switch to git, even if your team is already using and happy with hg.

No killer feature, but 10% wins:
* staging
* reflog
* rebase
* partial commit

In general, the thing that makes git standout is consistency.

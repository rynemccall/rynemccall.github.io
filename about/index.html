  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm a Senior Software Engineer with <a href="https://www.flipkey.com/">FlipKey</a>. (FlipKey is wholly owned by TripAdvisor.) At FlipKey, I help to build a vacation rental marketplace that connects millions of travelers with over 300,000 rental homes. Life is never dull for a developer at FlipKey; I develop across the entire stack, writing code in Python, PHP, JavaScript, and .NET.

  <p>Before coming to FlipKey, I worked for Tekelec in Raleigh, NC, developing tools to automate the testing of Tekelec's custom Linux platform. At Tekelec, I gained a deep appreciation for using open source software as the foundation for successful products.</p>

  <p>I graduated from North Carolina State University in 2009 with degrees in Computer Engineering and Economics. After a few years in industry, I returned to school and graduated with a Masters in Business Administration from Elon University in 2013.</p>
